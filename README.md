# Stroop Test Application

This web application is a modern implementation of the Stroop Test, designed to demonstrate cognitive interference and measure cognitive flexibility and control.

## Introduction

The Stroop Test is a psychological assessment that gauges the ease with which a person can shift their mental set. The application challenges users to name the color of a word being displayed, which can be difficult when the color and the word do not match.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the zip file and extract it.
